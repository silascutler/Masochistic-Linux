A fork of Suicide Linux
=================

Based on the idea mentioned on : http://qntm.org/suicide. Masochistic Linux will not wipe your root partition when you enter an unknown command. It will however, run the sl {steam locomotive} command to make sure you slow down.

Based on the source code @ https://bitbucket.org/sangyye/suicide-linux-script
