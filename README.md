Masochistic-Linux
=================

A fork of Suicide Linux

Based on the idea mentioned on : http://qntm.org/suicide, Masocistic Linux will no wipe your root partion when you mess up a command.  It will however, run the sl {steam locomotive} command to make sure you slow down.

Based on the source code @ https://bitbucket.org/sangyye/suicide-linux-script
